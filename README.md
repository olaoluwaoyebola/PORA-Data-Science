### Data Science Portfolio: Hands-On Learning \& Milestone Projects



A dedicated space to document my journey learning and applying Data Science concepts, tools, and techniques through practical, hands-on projects. This repository serves as a live portfolio showcasing my skill development from foundational tasks to complex, end-to-end milestone projects.



### Repository Goals



1. Learn by Doing: Prioritize practical application over theoretical study alone.
2. Track Progress: Document the evolution of my skills, from basic data manipulation to advanced machine learning model deployment.
3. Build a Portfolio: Showcase completed projects, code quality, problem-solving abilities, and documentation skills to potential employers or collaborators.
4. Maintain Resources: Keep a curated list of useful resources, datasets, and learning paths.

### NumPy

Learned how to use the numpy library in python. Created arrays and manipulated them; checking the shape, size, dimension, flattening an array, and also adding two arrays together.

### Pandas

Looked into the pandas library, learning how it works. Created and manipulated a pandas series.

Learned how to integrate sql into python using SQLite. We used the Chinook\_db to practice by exploring the data, performing operations like joins, sort, and also visualize the data.

### Matplotlib

Started out on how this python library works and practiced some visualizations.

### Plotly

Learned how to use plotly to create interactive visuals and dashboards. I also saw the difference between plotly and other visualisation libraries like matplotlib and seaborn, in that plotly is dynamic. It is interactive by default, supports zooming, hover toolips, panning, and export. It can also be integrated into web apps, and well suited for analytical dashboards. 

### Data Cleaning
Learned different methods of data cleaning and its usefulness.


### Machine Learning
The first two weeks for this section, I started out with the basics of supervised learning, including Regression concepts, Classification fundamentals, Train–test splitting, Overfitting vs underfitting, Performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, precision, recall). I to work on prjects to practice and solidify what I've learned so far.

Then I progressed into unsupervised learning, where the goal is to uncover hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Topics explored include:

Clustering concepts and use cases

K-Means clustering

Choosing the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method, WCSS)

Feature scaling for clustering

Interpreting and visualizing clusters

Practical applications of unsupervised learning in real-world datasets
